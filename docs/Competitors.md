# Overview of Available Culinary CMS

Currently, there are several CMS solutions focused on culinary topics, but many have various issues. Some are multi-platform but lack features for personal recipe books. Others focus on saving and consuming others' recipes, often just copying recipes from other sites.

The best solutions are tailored more for bloggers and influencers rather than home cooks. These solutions are often costly or require technical knowledge to set up.

## Umami

Umami is one of the best solutions for home cooks. It focuses on sharing recipes with family and friends. It includes features like shopping lists, meal plans, and exporting items to popular formats.

However, Umami has some drawbacks. It lacks multi-platform support and is currently available only on iOS, with plans for an Android app in the future. This limits its user base and forces content creation on a phone, which may be a disadvantage for many users.

## Paprika

Paprika is popular for its multi-platform support, with dedicated clients for macOS, iOS, Android, and Windows. However, it has some controversial decisions:

- Each platform requires a separate purchase despite using the same account.
- Users often lost data during updates due to lack of backward compatibility.

Paprika is the most feature-rich solution for cooking, portioning, and managing ingredients. However, its interface is not user-friendly, and sharing recipes is difficult.

## Yummly

Yummly focuses on recipe recommendations and building a personal recipe base. It offers tools to enhance the use of ready-made recipes:

- Recommendations based on cooking history and ratings.
- Meal planning with a focus on nutritional values and diet types.

However, Yummly's strength has become a weakness with its monetization. Suggested recipes often redirect to external sites. The app's complexity makes it cumbersome to navigate and use, especially in the kitchen.

## Conclusions

Despite how common cooking is as a hobby, there are surprisingly few apps that facilitate this activity. Existing apps are either too simple or overwhelming with features. Considering criteria like multi-platform support and offline mode, users have limited choices that meet their needs.
